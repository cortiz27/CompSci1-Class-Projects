# CompSci1-Class-Projects
This repository includes the projects I coded for my class. The Projects in this repository are, each, cumulative.

The goal for each project was to help a fictional company named Southern Shape Supply, Inc. by creating a program that handles orders from customers 
that would like to have shapes 3D printed with certain types of characteristics. Each project builds from the last as we learned new concepts.
